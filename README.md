## Why?

The project is sequel of my former efforts: [SD_soft_atmega328.patch] (../../../arduino_patches/wiki/SD_soft_atmega328.patch) and [SD_hard_atmega.patch]
(../../../arduino_patches/wiki/SD_hard_atmega.patch).

Main aim to replace this collection

![Before] (../../wiki/IMG_20160915_115301.jpg)

with the single board

![Now] (../../wiki/IMG_20160915_115419.jpg)

which is deprived of some hardware drawbacks.

All details you can see on [Wiki] (../../wiki)
